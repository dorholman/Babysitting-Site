<h1>About me</h1>
<h3>Experience:</h3>
<p>Ive been consistently babysitting for around a year and working with kids for many years. 
    I'm taking a basic early childcare class currently in school and I plan to take a more advanced class through the <a href="https://rsta.cpsd.us/about_rsta">RSTA program.</a>
</p>
<h3>Personal Interests:</h3>
<p>I love sports, nature, and animals. My favorite sports are volleyball, which I play for my highschool JV team, rock climbing, and running.
    I love to spend time in nature doing things like camping or swimming. If I could move anywhere in the world, I would move to Big Sur, California, or Yosemite National Park.
